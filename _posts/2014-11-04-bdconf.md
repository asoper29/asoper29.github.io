Day one of [BDConf](https://bdconf.com/events/orlando-2014/) is over, and it was... interesting. Things I expected to see:

* Gifs
* HTML and CSS
* Responsive Design
* Frameworks
* New tools / suggestions for improvement
* General mobile development conversation


Things I didn't expect to see:

* A song / ringtone / website about [Meat](http://www.wholesalemeatscoventry.co.uk/)
* A very emotional presentation
* "Every speaker here was wrong about most every piece of technical advice they gave" - Hampton Catlin
* Discussing how the design choices we make can have a global impact

The emotional [presentation](http://john.do/greater-agony/) was led by [Jon Saddington](https://twitter.com/saddington) and was a very detailed discussion of one of his biggest failures. This was a very personal presentation and I'm glad he shared. The important messages I pulled from his talk:

1. Make sure to analyze your costs prior to beginning your project. Don't assume anything.
2. Having a partner(s) will make a startup so much easier.
3. Startups are a huge commitment: you will be investing all of your time, resources, and energy into it.
4. Your personal life may suffer: loss of sleep, time with family, and more (Jon sold his car and his home to try and support his startup).
5. Failure can be agonizing: your brilliant idea may fail for any number of reasons.
6. The internet is not your friend when you fail. Don't fall into the trap of listening to all of the [haters](https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0cdbrqqfb1rqfhi2o1_500.gif)
7. Don't be afraid to share your story.


Jason VanLue's presentation was titled "A Study in Pixels", and I definitely didn't expect what he was going to discuss. Cliff notes version:

1. Improving internet accessibility could double the GDP in Africa and easily increase the standard of living for developing countries.
2. Our design choices can have a large global impact: most developing countries have limited internet access and very slow speeds. If you have a bloated site full of unnecessary features it can limit the access to those with constrictive internet.
3. We can help promote global growth through increasing internet access and improving on design.
